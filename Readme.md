Initial Approach

My initial thought is to go with an MVP (minimum viable product) approach making sure to deliver a simple solution that can be built and is adaptable. Simply supplying a file which is parsed into a list of objects which can then be processed and presented.

The presentation will consist of using a CLI and printing the results to the terminal. A user will be able to ask for most to least pages viewed, unique pages viewed or both printed to the terminal. 

The processing and parsing of the data will be handled away from the presentation layer.
